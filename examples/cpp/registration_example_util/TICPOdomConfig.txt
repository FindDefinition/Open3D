# This is a config file for the ICP Odometry Examples.
# When voxel_size is -1, no downsampling is performed.
# To run DemoTICPOdom:
# 1. Run script download_kitti_samples.sh.
# 2. Go to build/bin/examples
# 3. Run the following command:
# ./DemoTICPOdom CPU:0 ../../../examples/cpp/registration_example_util/TICPOdomConfig.txt
# Change CPU:0 to CUDA:0 for running it on primary GPU.

# Path of the downloaded dataset containing frames in .pcd format, named
# sequentially from 0.pcd to [end_range - 1].pcd.

# option to turn ON / OFF visualization:

# Verbosity can be Info, Debug.

# Registration method can be PointToPoint or PointToPlane.

# Scale 1:
